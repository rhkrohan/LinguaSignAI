## Introduction
A brief description of your project’s goal: to detect American Sign Language (ASL) gestures through computer vision and machine learning techniques.

## Project Overview
High-level overview of:
- The motivation behind the project (why it’s important).
- The general problem you’re solving (ASL sign recognition).
- The scope of the repository (notebooks, scripts, model weights).

## Approaches
Here you’ll detail the **two main ways** you tried to solve the problem.

### Approach 1
- **Methodology**: Briefly describe the overall pipeline (e.g., using a custom model, a particular library, or a specific feature-extraction technique).
- **Reasoning**: Why you chose this approach initially.
- **Advantages**: What made it appealing.
- **Challenges**: What you struggled with or why you moved on to a second approach.

### Approach 2
- **Methodology**: How it differs from Approach 1 (e.g., using transfer learning, a different data pipeline, or a more advanced architecture).
- **Reasoning**: Why you pivoted or experimented with this new approach.
- **Advantages** and **Challenges**: Summarize learnings.

## Data Collection and Preprocessing
- Where you sourced data (or how you recorded it).
- Steps taken to clean or organize it.
- Tools/libraries used for data preprocessing (e.g., MediaPipe, OpenCV, etc.).

## Model Architectures
- Detailed explanation of the final model(s) used (e.g., CNN, LSTM, Transformers).
- Key hyperparameters (layers, activation functions, learning rates).

## Training Process
- Hardware and software environment.
- Epochs, batch size, training time.
- Any data augmentation or regularization steps used.

## Evaluation and Results
- Metrics (accuracy, F1-score, confusion matrix).
- Comparison of the two approaches if relevant.
- Example outputs or visualizations.

## Usage
- Instructions to install dependencies, set up environment, run the notebooks or scripts.
- Example command lines.

## Future Work
- Plans for expanding, refining, or deploying the system.
- Possible improvements or additional features.

## Contributors
- List or mention everyone who contributed significantly, along with their roles or specific contributions.

## License
- State your chosen license (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0) and link to the `LICENSE` file if present.
