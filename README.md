## Introduction

Sign language is a vital communication method for the Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing community. However, the need for interpreters or specialized language training can create communication barriers in everyday interactions. To help address this challenge, our project focuses on building a machine learning-based **American Sign Language (ASL) detection model** that recognizes hand gestures in real time or from recorded video frames.

In this repository, we combine computer vision techniques and deep learning approaches to accurately classify a range of ASL gestures. Our workflow involves data extraction and preprocessing, model training using both custom and transfer learning strategies, and systematic experimentation to refine accuracy. Below is an overview of our motivations, goals, and how this project is organized:

1. **Motivation**  
   - **Bridging Communication Gaps**: Facilitating more inclusive communication for Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing individuals.  
   - **Practical Applications**: Enabling ASL recognition in various domains, such as interactive devices, educational software, and assistive technology.

2. **Goals**  
   - **Automate Gesture Recognition**: Develop an automated pipeline to detect and classify ASL signs directly from hand movement data.  
   - **Achieve High Accuracy**: Leverage both custom and transfer learning methods to improve recognition performance.  
   - **Promote Accessibility**: Provide a foundation for accessible tools that integrate gesture detection into real-world applications.

3. **Methodology Overview**  
   - **Data Extraction**: Using [MediaPipe](https://google.github.io/mediapipe/) to extract keypoints and landmarks from images or videos. (See the notebook *HandGestureDataExtraction(MediaPipe) (1).ipynb* for the hand-tracking pipeline.)  
   - **Custom Model Development**: Training a fresh neural network on the extracted dataset. (Detailed in *SignLanguageGestureDetectionModel (1).ipynb* and *SignLanguageDetection(trimmed_data).ipynb*.)  
   - **Transfer Learning**: Fine-tuning pre-trained image/video models to leverage learned features and boost performance. (Outlined in *TransferLearningModel.ipynb*.)

4. **Project Organization**  
   - **Notebooks**: Containing separate exploratory experiments, data-processing pipelines, and finalized model training.  
   - **Data Preprocessing**: Scripts and functions that read, clean, and format the dataset for quick prototyping.  
   - **Documentation**: This README (and other documents) explaining how each component fits together.  

By combining computer vision-based keypoint extraction and deep learning classification, we aim to deliver a robust solution for ASL gesture detection. In the subsequent sections, you’ll find details on the dataset, different modeling approaches, training procedures, and performance metrics that collectively illustrate the evolution of this project from initial data collection to a refined sign language detection pipeline.


## Project Overview
